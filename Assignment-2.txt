1)List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) v Nodejs
1.Definition:	
	Browser JS:JS Engine & Rendering Engine	
	Nodejs:(JS Runtime Environment) JS Engine(V8) & some C++ libraries
2.Where to use:
	Browser JS:FrontEnd	
		Nodejs:BackEnd
3.JS Engine:	
	Browser JS:Based on the browser V8 for Chrome, SpiderMonkey for Firefox, Chakra for IE & Edge, JS Core for Safari	
	Nodejs:V8 Engine
4.Global Object:	
	Browser JS:window	
	Nodejs:Global
5.Asynchronous Activity	
	Browser JS:WebAPIs handle	
	Nodejs:Libuv Library handle
6.Asynchronous Activity Thread	
	Browser JS:ThreadPool  In case of chrome it is managed IO thread	
	Nodejs:Thread pool of 4-Configured managed by libuv
7.Module System	
	Browser JS:ES6 Module System	
	Nodejs:Common JS
8.Event Loop	
	Browser JS:WebAPI and JS run time	
	Nodejs:Libuv

2)watch & summary 5 points - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmE4OwHztCc&ab_channel=JSConf
1.HTML Parsing
HTML uses Conventional parsing because HTML is not contex free grammar
Parsing-Translating a document into structure that code can use
Parsing consists a grammar
Vocabulary-Tags
Syntax Rule
 Parsing consists-
  	Lexical Analysis- Lexer(Toknizer)-Create Tokens
	Syntax Analysis- Parser -apply syntax rules
 Webkit uses Flex(lexer) and Bison(parser)
 If HTML code don’t have closing tag ,it will get add automatically and render it.

DOM(Document Object Model)
When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.
HTML parsing is the process of taking raw HTML code, reading it, and generating a DOM tree object structure from it.
The HTML DOM model is constructed as a tree of Objects:
It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated
DOM doesn’t specify any relationship between objects.
Object-HTML Tags (HEAD,BODY,h1,title)
Model-How you layout all the structure.

2.CSSOM
 The CSS Object Model is a set of APIs allowing the manipulation of CSS from JavaScript. 
 It is much like the DOM, but for the CSS rather than the HTML. 
 It allows users to read and modify CSS style dynamically.
 CSS uses unconventional parser

3.Render Tree
Generated while DOM tree is constructed
Visual elements in order which they are going to be displayed
 Elements in the render tree are called render or render objects
Render object is rectangle.

4.Layout
Calculates position and size
Most of the time possible to compute geometry in one pass
Recursive process begins at the root object(<html>)
Uses Dirty bit system

5.Paint
Uses Dirty bit system        
Render tree is being traversed and the paint() method is used to display content on this page
Painting order:
1.Background Color
2.Background Image
3.Border
4.Children
5.Outline


4)Execute the below code and write your description in txt file

a.console.log(typeof(1));
->number

b.console.log(typeof(1.1));
-->number

c.console.log(typeof('1.1'));
-->string

d.console.log(typeof(true));
-->boolean

e.console.log(typeof(null));
-->object

f.console.log(typeof(undefined));
-->undefined

g.console.log(typeof([]));
-->object

h.console.log(typeof({}));
-->object

i.console.log(typeof(NaN));
-->number
